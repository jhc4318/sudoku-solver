Summarise your findings here (see specification).

To determine the difficulty of the board, we can look at:
    - the number of function calls,
    - the maximum stack size achieved,
    - and the elapsed time to solve the board.

board name | no. function calls | max stack size | time elapsed (s)
-----------+--------------------+----------------+-----------------
mystery1   |       421546       |       58       |     0.137458
mystery2*  |        11532       |       49       |     0.003763
mystery3   |        14133       |       57       |     0.003655

*mystery2 did not yield a solution, and so it is the unsolvable board.

Comparing the maximum stack size yields little information on the difficulty of the board.
It is highly dependent on whether the initial guesses are accurate as this would lead to the greatest stack size.

Looking at the number of function calls gives us a much better idea of how difficult the board was.
Mystery1 took 29.8x more function calls than mystery3 to solve the board, which is indicative of how many more guesses the solver required to converge to the right solution.
This idea is reinforced when we look at the time elapsed, with mystery1 taking 37x longer to solve than mystery3.

Mystery1 is the "extremely hard" board and mystery3 is the "hard" board.
